# Outpatient-Dataset-Analysis-using-Python
Analyzed patient demographics, visit trends, and wait times across different departments to derive actionable insights such as identifying peak patient age-group and finding high wait time department.

Performed cost and insurance analysis, revealing an inverse relationship between insurance status and patient costs, with uninsured patients incurring nearly twice the cost on average.

Visualised data and provided evidence based insights, including constant average costs across years for both insured and uninsured patients.
